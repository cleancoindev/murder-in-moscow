7DRL Attempt: Murder in Moscow

Murder in Moscow will be a supernatural RL set in the afterlife.

Naively Hopeful Features:

* Play as an angel or demon 
* Crawl up to heaven or down to hell
* Rooms have words embedded in the walls  (e.g., XMURDERXX+XXXXRAGEXX)
* Ghosts say phrases extracted from Twitter
* Standard stuff (items, monsters, fighting, magic)

I'm going to build it in ruby using ncurses. (By the way, last night,
I discovered a fantastic set of ruby ncurses examples at: 
http://github.com/zdennis/ncurses_examples/tree/master )

This will be my third roguelike attempt.   The first two were
failures, attempted in secret.  We'll see how this one goes.
