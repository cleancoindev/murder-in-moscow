7DRL Attempt: Murder in Moscow

Murder in Moscow will be a zombie horror RL.

Naively Hopeful Features:

* Play as a survivor
* Build and tear down walls
* During the night, visibility is limity and zombies swarm
* Mental health meter, words start becoming embedded in the walls if your player witnesses too much gore (e.g., XMURDERXX+XXXXRAGEXX)
* Zombies moan zombified tweets extracted from Twitter

I'm going to build it in ruby using ncurses. (By the way, last night,
I discovered a fantastic set of ruby ncurses examples at: 
http://github.com/zdennis/ncurses_examples/tree/master )

This will be my third roguelike attempt.   The first two were
failures, attempted in secret.  We'll see how this one goes.
